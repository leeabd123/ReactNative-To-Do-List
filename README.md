**React Native To-Do List**

Created a React Native To-do list in an event sponsored by Hack4Impact in the CodeADA hackathon.

After given a introduction to JavaScript and ReactNative by Hack4Impact we were tasked with creating a to-do list app using React Native, HTML, and JavaScript. We were given some example code to use to assist us in creating a to-do list.

I used the onpressed function to create buttons and prompted for user inputs to modify data on the to-do list
